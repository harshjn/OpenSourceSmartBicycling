# OpenSourceSmartBicycling
A lot of hardware can be added to any bicycle to make it smart. So that, it tells you what speeds you move at, how much distances you travelled, and so on.

In addition, we can take a simple hard drive motor, from disposal, and add it to your bike, to provide as much as 5 watts. 
This would be enough to give you enough power to charge a small battery.
