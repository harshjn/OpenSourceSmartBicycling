# Our Mission
## Environment Friendly: 
We want to make bicycling **evergreen** and **plastic free** and a **lifelong part of your kid's life**. 
## Transparent Technology
Cycles are hundreds of years old technology and not rocket science. We want to make bicycle **technology transparent** and **easy to repair** for anyone, and for cheap.
Our bikes can be repaired from any nearest shop and support local repairing shops. We also provide you with the tools for self-repair via online tutorials.
## No mean business incentives
We want to keep our **profit margins reasonable and transparent**, and we want to support local repair professionals in your community and keep our customers happy.
Please support our initiative by reviewing us honestly on online platforms such as Amazon/Flipkart. 

# Unassembled Bikes:
Although some parts such as the plastic wheel and chaincover are plastic to keep the prices low for you, it is actually costlier for customers because of low resale value of 
plastics. In our business strategy, we aim to replace the plastic wheels with metal wheels by 2024. 

# Assembled Bikes:
90% assembled bikes can be assembled by yourself. Although, for perfect fitting, we would still recommend a professional checkup by your nearest cycle repair personnel.
