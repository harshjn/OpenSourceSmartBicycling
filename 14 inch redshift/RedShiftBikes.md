# Our Mission
## Environment Friendly: 
We want to make bicycling **evergreen** and **plastic free** and a **lifelong part of your kid's life**. 
## Transparent Technology
Cycles are hundreds of years old technology and not rocket science. We want to make bicycle **technology transparent** and **easy to repair** for anyone, and for cheap.
Our bikes can be repaired from any nearest shop and support local repairing shops. We also provide you with the tools for self-repair via online tutorials.
## No mean business incentives
We aim to keep our **profit margins reasonable and our business transparent**, and we want to support local repair professionals in your community and keep our customers happy.
Please support our initiative by reviewing us honestly on online platforms such as Amazon/Flipkart. 


# Our Technology Strategy
## By 2023:
We aim to get 1000 customers and supporters by the end of 2022.
Although some of our parts such as the plastic wheel and chaincover are plastic to keep the prices low for you, it is actually costlier for customers because of low resale value. With enough support, we will be able to break from the price cycle, and convince our customers to buy products which are more environment friendly. We plan to launch the kid's bike with metallic wheels before end of 2023. 

## By 2024:
We aim to replace the plastic wheels with metal wheels by 2024. 
During this time, we will keep posting tutorials for our customers to keep increasing their knowledge about bicycles. 

# Our Business Strategy
We are a family run small scale business from over 40 years, and we aim to remain free from investors at all times, and keep our intentions not laser-focussed on profits, but also support our customers and most importantly, the environment. You will consistently find our prices towards the lower segments among the competition and we can even make our balance sheet transparent if it doesn't harm our business (I don't know what would be good or bad for our business yet).  Like any publicly traded company, we will keep our figures transparent, and invest most of our earnings into technology. 
We don't expect you to believe us, but we would be happy to give tours to interested folks to visit our manufacturing place any time as well, to get exposure and our lifestyles and business methods will speak more to you.
