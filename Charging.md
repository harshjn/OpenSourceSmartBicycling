Let's calculate rpm of bicycle at 10 kmph. 
or, 160 meters per minute. 
For a cycle tyre with diameter 0.5 meters, the circumference is nearly 1.5 meters. That ends up giving us 100 revolutions per 
minute. Much less than rpm of a hard disk. 

What motor can give us enough power at 100 rpm? It'll require huge magnets.

If however, we couple a motor's spindle with the tyre, we need a diameter of 1cm, to get a gear ratio of 50, and an rpm as high as 5000. 
I expect an output of 5V and a current of 1Amps to charge a simple Li-ion battery. 

We can use a wireless charging coil. To attach and charge our phone. This is more beneficial because this will be waterproof and it doesn't involve open connections.
