Let's calculate rpm of bicycle at 10 kmph. 
or, 160 meters per minute. 
For a cycle tyre with diameter 0.5 meters, the circumference is nearly 1.5 meters. That ends up giving us 100 revolutions per 
minute. Much less than rpm of a hard disk. 

What motor can give us enough power at 100 rpm? It'll require huge magnets.

If however, our design is the external one, where we rotate with tyre, we need a diameter of 1cm, for the thing to be effective. That is doable. 

I expect an output of 5V and a current of 1Amps. Let's check on the internet if it actually exists in that form. I do expect so.

Next is, is 5W that we generate, enough to charge our battery? I suppose.
Next we use a wireless charging coil. To attach and charge our phone. This is more beneficial because this will be waterproof.
As it doesn't involve open connections.
We also charge a local battery.
